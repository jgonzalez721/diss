# UofA-dissertation-template-for-linguistics
This LaTeX template is based on [J. J. Charfman's version for Astronomy](https://da.overleaf.com/latex/templates/university-of-arizona-astronomy-thesis-template/tsfqcgnfmjcx) and has been adapted to linguistics.

To use this template, you can either download the .zip file or clone the repository. Then you can either use it locally with your favourite editor, or on a remote platform such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

If you know your way around a makefile and have the necessary prerequisites installed, you can also just call `make` or `make -f Makefile` while in the directory. This will generate a `build/` directory where all your files and the compiled PDF will be dumped.

Happy writing.
